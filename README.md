# Lessons Learned

This project was really difficult for me.  The planning was really difficult with the UML.  I took pieces of code from a variety of sources and made this into my own project.  Some of my ambitions outweighed my abilities.  I would like to expand on this project and do some of the stretch goals that I didn't get to.

Some of the areas I really need to focus on are understanding ArrayLists.
