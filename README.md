# Blackjack Project

This is a simple blackjack game with basic features.  It lacks some of the more advanced features of blackjack at this time, such as splitting on doubles.

# Description

This is a console based blackjack game written in Java. The main is in BlackjackApp and you run the application from there.  Most of the game logic is in the GameLoop class.  A Card class was created using the Rank and Suit classes.  The deck class created the deck for blackjack and set the total value for the hands including using the ace card as 1 or 11.

# Technologies Used

JAVA (OOP)

# Lessons Learned

This project was really difficult for me.  The planning was really difficult with the UML.  I took pieces of code from a variety of sources and made this into my own project.  Some of my ambitions outweighed my abilities.  I would like to expand on this project and do some of the stretch goals that I didn't get to given some more time to work on the project.

Some of the areas I really need to focus on are understanding ArrayLists and better using a UML.

I am still behind where I want to be relative to the instruction being taught, but I am seeing progress.
